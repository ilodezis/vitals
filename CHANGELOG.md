## [Unreleased]

### Added — HRT / TRT

- **HRT / TRT** (new Optional module, `hrt`) — harm-reduction tracker for hormone/TRT and anabolic-steroid cycles: testosterone esters, ancillaries (AI/SERM/HCG), cycle compounds (tren/EQ/mast/primo/orals) and GH/IGF-1/peptides. Tracking only — no dosing advice.
- Curated **compound catalog** (`vitals/data/hrt_compounds.yaml`, 73 molecules across 15 classes) with ester, route, half-life and active-hormone mass fraction; seeded idempotently on startup by `hrt_catalog.sync_catalog` (keyed on a stable `key` slug, like the conflict-rule catalog). Multi-ester blends (Sustanon) carry a per-ester breakdown.
- **Dose log** with ml→mg computation (volume × concentration) and grey-market provenance fields (brand / lab / batch / measured concentration) on each administration; HRT-specific injection-site rotation grid; side-effect log graded 1-5.
- Conflict-engine resolver (`hrt_service.resolve_active`) exposing recently-dosed compounds so cross-domain rules can reference the current protocol.
- Optional module, default OFF; migration `0024_hrt` creates the tables.

### Added — HRT cycles, release model & bloodwork

- **Cycles** (`HrtCycle`/`HrtCycleItem`, migration `0025_hrt_cycles`) — protocol plans by kind (trt_baseline/blast/cruise/pct/bridge), each with a per-compound **schedule engine**: segment lists (flat or a linear ramp) expanded off a fixed grid anchored at the cycle start, supporting fractional intervals (E3.5D) and titration.
- **Active-release model** — a server-rendered curve estimating active-hormone mg in the body over time (sum of each administration's exponential decay by half-life × active fraction), over actual doses plus the active cycle's projected plan.
- **Protocol-aware reminders** (daily scheduler job `hrt_reminders`) — bloodwork-due while on cycle (cadence by kind) and missed-injection nags off the fixed grid; both idempotent passive alerts. Seeds a hormone/safety **bloodwork panel** into the Labs catalog with retest intervals.
- **Cross-domain safety rules** (soft_warn, never block) — oral 17-aa + high ALT/AST, active testosterone + high hematocrit, 19-nor + high prolactin.
- **MCP tools** — `log_hrt_dose`, `get_hrt_logs`, `add_hrt_cycle`, `add_hrt_cycle_item`, `get_hrt_cycles`.

### Added — HRT week-staggered courses & shareable cycle templates

- **Per-compound start offset** (`start_offset_days` on `HrtCycleItem`, migration `0026`) — a cycle item's schedule grid can now anchor at `cycle start + N days` instead of day 0, enabling real multi-compound week-anchored protocols (e.g. an oral from week 5, ancillaries weeks 5–9, PCT weeks 11–13). The web form takes a friendly "start week" field; planned doses, the release curve and injection reminders all respect the offset.
- **Cycle templates** (`HrtCycleTemplate`/`HrtCycleTemplateItem`, migration `0027`) — save an active cycle's plan as a **date-free, reusable template** and later materialize it into a new cycle at any start date (kind, per-compound offsets and schedules carry over; the usual open-cycle auto-close applies).
- **Template sharing** — export any template as portable JSON (`vitals.hrt_cycle_template` v1, copyable share-code block or `.json` download) and import someone else's by pasting it; portable across self-hosted instances because items reference the shared compound catalog by slug. Imports are strictly validated (envelope/version, cycle kind, units, offsets, compound keys against the local catalog, schedule shape) and never half-import.
- **Schedule validation hardened** — all cycle-item write paths (form, MCP, template import) now funnel through a single `validate_schedule` normalizer that rejects malformed segments and strips unknown keys.
- Active-cycle card now shows the kind's bloodwork cadence, so cycle kinds visibly differ beyond the label.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-12

### Changed — Timeline

- Cross-domain event feed now draws from every domain instead of 5: added supplement start/stop, skincare product added/removed, GLP-1 side effects (severity ≥ 3), full milestone lifecycle (set/achieved/missed, not just achieved), genetics import batches, and progress photos (rendered inline as a thumbnail — BIA/InBody scan sheets get the same thumbnail treatment for free)
- Lab-draw events now reflect the actual result: tone follows the worst flag in that day's batch (critical/out-of-range/normal) instead of always rendering neutral, and flagged marker names appear in the event detail
- Fixed a rendering bug where `warn`-tone events (illness/travel annotations, noisy-weight periods) were visually indistinguishable from `bad`-tone ones — they now use separate colors

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added — Timeline

- **Timeline** (13th module) — cross-domain event feed: manual annotations (life events, illness, travel, protocol changes) merged with events derived live from other domains' own rows (GLP-1 dose changes, lab draws, BIA scans, achieved milestones, noisy weight periods)
- Manual annotation flags rendered as Chart.js overlays on the weight chart and any custom chart whose series touch an annotated domain
- MCP: `get_timeline` (read) and `log_event` (write) — 37 tools total (22 read + 15 write)
- Optional module (`timeline`), toggleable in Settings; migration `0018_timeline_annotations` seeds it ON
- `export_llm` gained a `timeline_annotations` block; full backup/restore picks up the new `annotations` table automatically

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-27

### Initial public release

**Core infrastructure**
- FastAPI application with Jinja2 + HTMX + Alpine.js frontend
- PostgreSQL 15 + SQLAlchemy 2 async ORM + Alembic migrations
- Redis for scheduler locks and Garmin session caching
- Docker Compose setup with loopback-only port binding (`127.0.0.1:8000`)
- APScheduler for background jobs
- Atomic database backup & restore

**Authentication & Security**

2. **GLP-1 Protocol** — Injection log (Semaglutide / Tirzepatide); dose phase overlays; plateau detection (>14 days, <100g/week trend)
3. **Garmin Connect** — Auto-sync via garth: HRV, sleep, resting HR, stress, Body Battery, Training Readiness; Health Auto Export JSON fallback

12. **MCP Integration** — 25 FastMCP tools (14 read + 11 write) for Claude.ai via OAuth 2.0 + PKCE

**Architecture**

- `raw_payloads` JSONB table: all API responses preserved for future re-parsing
- Conflict Engine: soft/hard warnings with override audit trail

- `python run_local.py` — SQLite + FakeRedis, no Docker needed
- 20 test modules, 100+ tests
- Integration test suite against real Postgres (`scripts/test_postgres.sh`)
